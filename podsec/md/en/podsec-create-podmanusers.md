podsec-create-podmanusers(1) -- creating users that run containers of signed images
=================================

## SYNOPSIS

`podsec-create-podmanusers username ...`

## DESCRIPTION

The script creates users of container images that have rights to run signed images in `rootless` mode.

## OPTIONS

- The script receives a list of users to create as parameters.

- The users are assigned the `podman` group. Users use the system files `/etc/containers/policy.json`, `/etc/containers/registries.d/default.yaml` as image access policies.

- The local user configuration files generated by the script in the `~/.config/containers/` directory are closed for changes.

## EXAMPLES

`podsec-create-podmanusers user1 user2 user3`

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

- Each user has its own namespace.

- All used images are downloaded only from the registrars specified in the policy file `/etc/containers/policy.json` and placed in the user's local cache;

- Containers are launched in their own namespace, stored in the local cache and are not available to other users

- The system file `/etc/containers/registries.d/defaylt.yaml` is used to verify the signature of images. All signatures are stored in the local `WEB-server` for the created cluster at the address`: ` http://sigstore.local:81/sigstore/`
