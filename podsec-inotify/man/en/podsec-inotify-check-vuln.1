\fBpodsec\-inotify\-check\-vuln\fR \- script for monitoring docker images of the node with the trivy security scanner
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpodsec\-inotify\-check\-vuln [\-m EMail]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For the script to work correctly, the \fBtrivy\fR service must be started: \fBsystemctl enable \-\-now trivy\fR
.P
The script monitors \fBdocker images\fR of the node with the \fBtrivy\fR security scanner:
.IP "\[ci]" 4
If the script is run as the \fBroot\fR user, the script:
.IP "\[ci]" 4
checks \fBrootfull\fR images with the \fBtrivy\fR scanner;
.IP "\[ci]" 4
for all users of the \fB/home/\fR directory, the presence of \fBrootless\fR images is checked\. If they are present, the \fBtrivy\fR scanner checks these images\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
If the script is run as a regular user, it checks for \fBrootless\fR images\. If they are present, it scans these images with the \fBtrivy\fR scanner\.
.IP "" 0
.P
The analysis result is sent to the system log\. If the \fB\-m\fR flag is present, if the number of \fBHIGH\fR threats detected during image analysis is greater than 0, the result is sent by mail to the system administrator (\fBroot\fR)\.

.IP "\[ci]" 4
The schedule file \fBpodsec\-inotify\-check\-vuln\.timer\fR, which specifies the schedule for starting the service \fBpodsec\-inotify\-check\-vuln\.service\fR in the \fBOnCalendar\fR parameter\. The service is called every hour\.
